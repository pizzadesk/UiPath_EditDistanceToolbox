# String Distance Calculation Library for UiPath

## Overview

This library offers a set of UiPath workflows that use `Invoke Code` activities to calculate string distances and similarities. It supports the following algorithms:

- **Levenshtein Distance**  
- **Hamming Distance**  
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**  
- **Jaro Distance**  

Each workflow accepts two input strings and outputs the calculated distance or similarity score.

## Features

- **Simple Integration**: Designed for easy use within UiPath workflows.  
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for applications like data validation, error correction, and duplicate detection in databases.

## Usage

1. Import the library into your UiPath project.  
2. Use the desired workflow to calculate string distances or similarities.  
3. Provide two input strings to the workflow.
